# `06` Listening for events

Events work in react pretty much the same way they do in Vanilla JS: if you want to listen for the user `Click`, all you have to do is add your onClick property (or any other event) to the HTML tag, how it is usually done.

The current code has one component that prints "I was clicked!" to the console.

## üìù Instructions:

1. Update the **Alert** component to call it correctly and then check the console.
